# Bamazon

Welcome to Bamazon! In this assignment I created workflows for both the manager and the customer.  The customer can order products and the manager can work in the background.

## Getting Started

Clone and Type the following commands within your command prompt to see how both a customer and manager would interact with the app:

node bamazonCustomer.js

node bamazonManager.js

Here is a video showing a demo of the Bamazon application!
